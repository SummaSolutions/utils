# Snippets

## Important note:
### From now on, please use the [new repo](https://bitbucket.org/summasolutions/summa-snippets) for snippets.



- Each folder contains an individual snippet (usually one only file, but it could have more than one).
- Also in each folder it should be a README.me file with a brief usage description (markdown or plain text).
